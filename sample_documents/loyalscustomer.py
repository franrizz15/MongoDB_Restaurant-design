# Alternatively we could use the bucket pattern for the dicount threshold relation

# "thresholds": [
#     { "update_date": "2025-06-01", "max_discount": 0.20 },

# Pros
# Efficient Reads: Fetching all related records (e.g., all discount thresholds 
# for a year) requires only one document read.
# Reduced Document Count: Fewer documents in the collection, which can improve 
# index and storage efficiency.
# Logical Grouping: Related data is grouped together, making it easier to 
# manage and archive.
# Cons
# Document Size Limit: Buckets can grow large and may eventually hit MongoDBâ€™s 
# 16MB document size limit.
# Update Complexity: Adding or removing items from a bucket requires updating 
# the whole document, 
# which can cause contention or performance issues with frequent writes.
# Difficult Partial Updates: Updating a single item inside a large array 
# can be less efficient than updating a standalone document.
# Query Limitations: Querying for a specific item inside a bucket may be 
# less efficient than querying individual documents.
